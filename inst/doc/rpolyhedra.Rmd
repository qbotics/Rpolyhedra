#Introduction
This package is a curation made based on the poly package found on http://www.netlib.org/polyhedra/ ([Original Help message](poly_original_help_message.html)), which provides a library of polyhedron and its representation. As such, Rpolyhedra provides with the following:

1. A module to scrape the polyhedra PHD files provided by the original poly command. 
1. A library of the scraped polyhedra.
1. An R6 polyhedron representation with 'rgl' package visualizing capabilites. 

#Usage
The package provides a simplified set of functions to scrape, show the scrapped polyhedra and access each individual polyhedron. 

##Scrape polyhedra
In order to scrape, the following code can be executed to retrieve all polyhedra from the original files produced by the poly command. 

``` R
library(Rpolyhedra)
polyhedra <- scrapePolyhedra(max.quant = 5, "polyhedra.RDS", home.dir.data = getDataDir(),
        test = TRUE)
```

##Get available polyhedra
Once the original files had been processed, a simple call to ```getAvailablePolyhedra()``` retrieves a list of the available polyhedra:

```R 
library(Rpolyhedra)
getAvailablePolyhedra()
```

##Retrieve a polyhedron
The access to a particular polyhedron can be done with a call to ```getPolyhedron(<<name>>)```, which returns a Polyhedron object. For example, to retrieve a cube, the call would be:

```R 
library(Rpolyhedra)
getPolyhedron("cube")
```

#A demo
In order to appreciate the package funcionality, a simple demo can be executed which shows the 5 regular polyhedra.

```R 
polyhedra.2.draw <- getAvailablePolyhedra()[1:5]
n <- length(polyhedra.2.draw)
polyhedron.colors <- rainbow(n)
polyhedron.scale <- 5

open3d()
par3d(FOV = 1)
rgl.bg( sphere =FALSE, fogtype = "none", color=c("black"))
rgl.viewpoint(theta = 0,phi=0,zoom=0.8,fov=1)
i <- 1
for (polyhedron.name in polyhedra.2.draw) {
  polyhedron <- getPolyhedron(polyhedron.name)
  current.angle <- i/n * 2 * pi
  shape.rgl <- polyhedron$getRGLModel(1, c(polyhedron.scale * sin(current.angle),
                                           polyhedron.scale * cos(current.angle),
                                           0))
  shade3d(shape.rgl, color = polyhedron.colors[i])
  i <- i + 1
}
```
